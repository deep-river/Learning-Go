/*
In the previous example we used explicit locking with mutexes to synchronize access to shared state across multiple goroutines. Another option is to use the built-in synchronization features of goroutines and channels to achieve the same result.

This channel-based approach aligns with Goâ€™s ideas of sharing memory by communicating and having each piece of data owned by exactly 1 goroutine.

In this example our state will be owned by a single goroutine. This will guarantee that the data is never corrupted with concurrent access.

In order to read or write that state, other goroutines will send messages to the owning goroutine and receive corresponding replies.

These readOp and writeOp structs encapsulate those requests and a way for the owning goroutine to respond
